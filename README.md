Syntax to run the project:

./oss -h -n [#] -s [#] -t [#]

run ./oss for more detail on syntax and what each flag does.

Difficulties:

I couldn't get shared memory to work for the life of me until the very end. So I got to the point where shared memory was created and I could write to it if I wanted but timed out when I got to the point of getting worker to interact with it. I also deleted my oss.cpp file on accident which I hadn't backed up for quite some time so I lost a few days worth of work which really sucks but at least I learned a life leason.
